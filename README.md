## Common Questions 🤔

- **License**: There is no license for this project. This project is open-source. Any people can modify the program as they please. However please consider that I do not own the datas from Goyfield. I had personally talked to the owner of Goyfield to make this project. 

- **Data**: The data updates approximately every 30~60minutes. Unfournately, I can't reduce it to less than 30 minutes becasue of rate limits.

- **API**: The API link is [here](https://nodev123.github.io/endfield-tracker-api-v2/stats.json). The API is in JSON Format.
